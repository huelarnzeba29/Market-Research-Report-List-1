<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passive Hydroponics Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydroponic Drip Systems</li><li>Flood & Drain Systems</li><li>N.F.T. (Nutrient Film Technique)</li><li>Water Culture Hydroponic Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passive hydroponic systems utilize minimal mechanical components for growing plants without soil, focusing on efficient nutrient delivery. Hydroponic drip systems employ a network of tubes to deliver nutrient solution directly to plant roots, promoting growth while minimizing waste. Flood and drain systems periodically flood the growing area with nutrient solution, then drain it to enhance oxygenation. Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) uses a thin film of nutrient solution that continually flows over plant roots, ensuring constant nourishment. Water culture systems suspend plants directly in nutrient-rich water, supporting rapid growth. These systems cater to various cultivation needs and preferences in the hydroponics market.</p></p>
