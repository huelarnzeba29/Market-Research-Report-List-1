<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fish Meal Plants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Processing</li><li>Dry Processing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fish meal plants employ two primary processing methods: wet and dry processing. </p><p>Wet processing involves cooking fish, extracting oil and liquid, and then drying the remaining solids, resulting in high-quality fish meal. This method is often used for species with high oil content, ensuring maximum nutrient retention.</p><p>Dry processing, on the other hand, involves directly cooking fish without prior oil extraction, leading to a more cost-effective production process. It typically yields a lower-quality meal but is widely used for less oily fish varieties.</p></p>
