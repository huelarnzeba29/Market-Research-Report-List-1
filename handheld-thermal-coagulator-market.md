<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Thermal Coagulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar Coagulator</li><li>Multipolar Coagulator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The handheld thermal coagulator market features two main types: unipolar and multipolar coagulators. Unipolar coagulators utilize a single electrode to deliver current through tissue, effectively coagulating and cutting with precision. In contrast, multipolar coagulators use multiple electrodes to distribute energy across a larger area, leading to efficient tissue coagulation with reduced thermal spread and minimal damage to surrounding tissues. Both types are widely used in surgical settings for procedures requiring controlled thermal effects in tissue management.</p></p>
