<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Turboexpander Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Turboexpander</li><li>Axial Turboexpander</li><li>Radial-Axial Turboexpander</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The turboexpander market comprises three primary types: radial turboexpanders, axial turboexpanders, and radial-axial turboexpanders. Radial turboexpanders utilize a wheel with blades that expand gas perpendicularly, offering high efficiency for gas cooling and refrigeration applications. Axial turboexpanders use a series of blades arranged along a shaft to expand gas in a linear direction, ideal for large-scale power generation. Radial-axial turboexpanders combine both designs, providing versatility for various industrial applications, including natural gas processing and energy recovery systems.</p></p>
